## Data challenges for the FAIR2Adapt RiOMar Case study 

This case study is led by [IFREMER](http://ifremer.fr) and builds on the outcomes of the RiOMar Project - Coastal Water Quality Anticipation to manage coastal zone ecosystem responses for biodiversity conservation. The RiOMar project’s data is high-resolution and complex to manipulate. To effectively support climate adaptation strategies and plans, it is crucial to maintain the high-resolution quality while enabling efficient data fusion with diverse datasets.

## About the Workhathon

We are excited to invite a select group of experts to an exclusive workhathon focused on exploring the integration of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) into future data workflows for the FAIR2Adapt project, using high-resolution RiOMar data. This event will assess how to develop a preprocessing pipeline for publishing datasets into DGGS grids and evaluate how this approach can streamline data co-location and fusion, providing critical support for climate adaptation strategies.

This workhathon aims to lay the foundation for future efforts in FAIR2Adapt by:

- **Deep Dive into DGGS**: Explore the fundamentals and advantages of DGGS for high-resolution spatial data management, with a focus on leveraging [xdggs](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xdggs) for scalable and efficient analysis.
- **Assess RiOMar Data**: Examine the RiOMar datasets and associated metadata to evaluate their readiness for DGGS integration and explore how tools within the Pangeo ecosystem can facilitate data access and preprocessing.
- **Pipeline Development**: Design and initiate a data processing pipeline using Healpix (DGGS), xDGGS, and Zarr, aligned with FAIR principles and leveraging the Pangeo stack for scalable workflows.
- **Support Data Fusion**: Demonstrate how DGGS, combined with Pangeo’s data processing and visualization capabilities, facilitates seamless integration of RiOMar data with other datasets, advancing the development of climate adaptation strategies.

## Event Details

- Dates: 16-19 January 2025
- Location: TBD
- By invitation only. Invitees will receive a detailed agenda and preparation materials.
